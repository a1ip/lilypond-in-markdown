# Lilypond in Markdown

My previous way of blogging about music was too tedious. This is a proof of concept to show that LilyPond markup can be rendered to inline SVG for the web.

I wrote a blog post about what I did [here](https://pianomanfrazier.com/post/lilypond-in-markdown).

In order to build the project the LilyPond extension assumes that `lilypond` is available in your path. So you must first install [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/download.html). I have committed the current cache of the built LilyPond output so that Netlify will successfully build and deploy the example page.
