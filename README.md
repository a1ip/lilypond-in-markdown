# Lilypond in Markdown

My previous way of blogging about music was too tedius. This is a proof of concept to show that lilypond markup can be rendered to inline SVG for the web.

In order to build the project the Lilypond extension assumes that `lilypond` is available in your path. So you must first install [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/download.html). I have commited the current cache of the built lilypond output so that Netlify will successfuly build and deploy the example page.
